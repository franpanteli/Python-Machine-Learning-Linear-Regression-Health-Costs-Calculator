# Python-Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression-Health-Costs-Calculator
This repository showcases my independent work which implements a neural network-based model for predicting healthcare expenses, as part of the [fourth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/linear-regression-health-costs-calculator) in freeCodeCamp's [Machine Learning with Python curriculum.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#how-neural-networks-work) Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, the neural network is structured sequentially with an input normalisation layer, two hidden layers using rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions, and an output layer with a single node. The model is compiled with a mean absolute error (MAE) loss function, the Adam optimisation algorithm (learning rate: 0.001), and metrics for MAE and mean squared error (MSE). The dataset, stored in data.csv, encompasses various patient demographics, including sex, age, BMI, and the number of children. Preprocessing steps in the Jupyter notebook ((ipynb) Fran Panteli fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb) include normalising patient information using the neural network's normalisation layer to ensure consistent scaling. Training occurs on 80% of the dataset, with evaluation on the remaining 20%. The model undergoes 600 epochs with a 0.2 validation split to monitor potential overfitting. A plotting function visualises the training and validation loss curves. Unit tests assess predictive accuracy using 20% of the dataset reserved for testing. Metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) are employed, alongside a scatter plot illustrating the correlation between true and predicted healthcare expenses. Success criteria involve achieving an MAE below 3500. In summary, this repository encompasses the neural network architecture, dataset, Jupyter notebook, and unit tests for a healthcare expenses prediction model, offering insights into the application of machine learning in healthcare analytics.
