# Python-Machine-Learning-KNN-Recommendation-Engine
This repository showcases my independent work for the [third machine learning project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/book-recommendation-engine-using-knn) as part of freeCodeCamp's [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) course. This project developed a Book Recommendation Engine using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in a Jupyter environment with Google Collaboratory. This used the Book-Crossings dataset, encompassing 1.1 million ratings across 270,000 books and 90,000 users. The pandas module was first used to perform preprocessing and cleaning on this data. This filtered out reviewers with fewer than 200 ratings and books with fewer than 100 ratings, to maintain statistical significance of the dataset. The sklearn.neighbors library was used to calculate book similarity based on distances in the multidimensional vector space of book reviews. This project used K-Means clustering to group books into clusters of six. A key component of the project is the 'get_recommends' function, which uses this to generate a list of five book recommendations given a specific book title by identifying its five nearest neighbors within the cluster and returning an array of their distances to the input book. This function successfully passed unit tests, ensuring its functionality and accuracy when applied to this dataset.
